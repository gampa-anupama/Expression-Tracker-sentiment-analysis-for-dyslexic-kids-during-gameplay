Summary:
The server allows image uploads to the /uploads endpoint.
The image is saved to the uploads folder on the server.
Once uploaded, the image is sent to the Hugging Face API for facial expression analysis.
The server logs both the uploaded image details and the API response to the console.
This structure is useful for any application where users can upload images for analysis
 or processing by external services like AI models.
